 # Smart Lender
 ## Introduction:
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost every bank's fundamental business is loan distribution. The majority of the bank's assets 
are directly derived from the profit made from the loans distributed by the bank. The primary goal in the 
banking industry is to place their funds in safe hands. Today, many banks/financial organizations grant 
loans following a lengthy verification and validation process, but there is no guarantee that the chosen 
applicant is the most deserving of all applicants. We can forecast whether a given application is safe or not 
using this approach, and the entire feature validation procedure is automated using machine learning 
techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are numerous hazards associated with bank loans, both for the bank and for those who obtain 
them. Risk analysis in bank loans necessitates an awareness of what risk entails. Risk refers to the likelihood 
of specific outcomes—or the uncertainty of those outcomes—particularly a current negative danger to 
achieving a current monetary activity. Credit risk is the possibility that the loan will not be repaid on time 
or at all; liquidity risk is the possibility that too many deposits will be withdrawn too quickly, leaving the 
bank short on cash; and interest rate risk is the possibility that interest rates on bank loans will be too low 
to earn enough money for the bank.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the improvement in the banking sector, many people are applying for bank loans, but the bank 
has limited assets that it can only grant to a limited number of people, so determining who the loan can be 
granted to and who will be a safer option for the bank is a typical process. This process of predicting if a 
loan should be approved or not can be automated using Machine Learning. This is accomplished by mining 
Big Data for previous records of the people to whom the loan was previously granted, following which the 
machine is trained using machine learning algorithms based on these records/experiences. Previous research 
in this era has revealed that there are numerous methods for studying the problem of loan default control. 
However, because accurate predictions are critical for profit maximization, it is critical to investigate the 
nature of the various methods and compare them. In this paper, various machine learning algorithms that 
have been used in past are discussed and their accuracy is evaluated</p>

## Motivation:
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main motivation behind this application is to make the process of loan credibility easier. Because today it will take plenty of time to check if the person is 
applicable for loan or not. As they need to check each document manually. It will be disheartening for people to know if their loan is rejected even after spending 
lots of time. Hence, we plan to make this process of prediction easy and automated. The users will get results almost accurately and quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the loan prediction app today uses only CIBIL score to predict the 
borrower’s credibility. But even with higher CIBIL score many loans are rejected. So, we decided to create an application which not only consider CIBIL scores 
but also Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan 
Amount, Credit history, etc., and decide if they are creditworthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application we are going to create, will save a lot of time and energy of 
the applicant as well as the bank. As the applicants don’t need to travel to banks 
and wait for long hours to check if they are credible and the banks also don’t need 
to manually check the user’s documents which will take a plenty of time. The 
model we are going to develop helps the bank as well as the users in predicting the 
user’s loan credibility</p>

## Objective:
### Minimizing risk
<p> The loan is approved by predicting if the loan can be 
given to that person on the basis of various parameters like credit score, income, 
age, marital status, gender, etc. The prediction model not only helps the applicant 
but also helps the bank by minimizing the risk and reducing the number of 
defaulters. Banks need to analyze for the person who applies for the loan will 
repay the loan or not.</p>

### Less time consumption
<p>Bankers cannot analyze the huge amounts of data manually; it may 
become a big process to check whether a person will repay its loan or not. With our model the prediction will be done in less amount of time</p>

### Increase efficiency
<p> Starting with the loan application, the digital lending platform 
manages every step of the loan origination process. It facilitates more efficient 
monetary transactions and a smooth money lending process. It also aids banking 
organizations in increasing productivity by transforming the entire work process.</p>
